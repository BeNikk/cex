# Centralised exchange

I happen to learn some Finance terms in building this, here are some

- Limit Order - Buy/sell an asset at a particular price, the trade might not execute immediately.
- Market Order - Buy/sell an asset at the best available price, trade will happen immediately.
- Order Book - List of all buy and sell orders, sorted by price. 
- Liquidity - How easily an asset can be bought/sold. 
- Spread - Difference between the highest buy price and lowest sell price, lesser the spread, more the liquidity.
- Maker / Market maker - someone who adds liquidity, by adding orders on both sides, in order for trades to be executed smoothly, companies like Citadel provides these making, in return they get better prices, etc. 
- Slippage - Difference between expected price and the actual price, may arise due to latency, or other reasons. We can put an upper cap.
- Leverage - Borrowing money to trade bigger positions, higher the leverage, your position in the asset becomes higher
- Margin - The amount we put against getting leverage, once the margin we put is exhausted, our leveraged position is closed.
- Arbitrage - Buying low on one market, selling high on another for profit.
